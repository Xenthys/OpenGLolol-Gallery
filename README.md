**OpenGLolol** is a project dedicated to *low-quality art* of just about anything!

### Submissions

Pull requests are accepted, with emphasis on original work. Preferred formats are PNG, SVG and GIF for animations.

* No nudity, gore, or anything that violates GitHub terms of service.
* Max file size of ~5M per image.

### Usage

This repository provides a script, `generategallery.py`, that takes all the images in the current folder and spits out an `index.html` in the current directory (or one specified on the command line). `.txt` files with the same name as each image are read as captions for them, if one exists.
